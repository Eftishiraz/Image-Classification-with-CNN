# Image-Classification-with-CNN
This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset, built with PyTorch. The project demonstrates deep learning techniques to recognize and categorize images across 10 different classes, showcasing the power of CNNs in handling complex visual data.
