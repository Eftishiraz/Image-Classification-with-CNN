# Image-Classification-with-CNN
This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset, built with Keras framework. The project demonstrates deep learning techniques to recognize and categorize images across 10 different classes, showcasing the power of CNNs in handling complex visual data.
## About
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32×32 color images with 50000 training images and 10000 test images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. These classes are: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship and truck. The solution is in convolutional neural network  on the dataset. The images in CIFAR-10 are of size 3x32x32, i.e. 3-channel color images of 32x32 pixels in size.

Image classification using deep learning has become very popular, and seems to be one of the best methods. Deep learning algorithm gives better accuracy than machine learning classifiers. Images with more features require more sophisticated networks that are able to consider the translation invariance of features, and other important aspects of image classification.
