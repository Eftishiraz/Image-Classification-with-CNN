# Image-Classification-with-CNN
This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset, built with Keras framework. The project demonstrates deep learning techniques to recognize and categorize images across 10 different classes, showcasing the power of CNNs in handling complex visual data.
## About
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32×32 color images with 50000 training images and 10000 test images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. These classes are: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship and truck. The solution is in convolutional neural network  on the dataset. The images in CIFAR-10 are of size 3x32x32, i.e. 3-channel color images of 32x32 pixels in size.
